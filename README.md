### Mobile Device Usage - Operating System Prediction Model

#### Project Overview  
This project, **Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior**, was developed by **Kaohsiung Dlamini**. The primary aim was to build a predictive model that determines whether a user prefers iOS or Android based on their behavior patterns. The analysis focused on a dataset of 700 phone users, encompassing demographic and phone usage characteristics such as age, gender, screen time, data consumption, and app usage trends.

#### Mission  
The project seeks to assist mobile device manufacturers and service providers by answering the following questions:  

1. **Can user behavior data predict their preferred operating system?**  
2. **What key factors differentiate iOS users from Android users?**  
3. **How does battery efficiency differ between iOS and Android devices?**

---

#### Key Objectives  
1. Develop a classification model capable of predicting the operating system (iOS or Android) based on user behavior data.  
2. Provide actionable insights into user habits and system efficiency to inform design or marketing strategies.  
3. Compare battery usage patterns to identify optimization opportunities.

#### Tools  
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model development.  
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and interactive dashboards.

#### Analysis Workflow  
1. **Data Exploration**
2. **Feature Engineering**
3. **Modeling**:  
4. **Insights**:

#### Results & Conclusion  
- The model reliably predicts a user's preferred operating system with reasonable accuracy.  
- iOS devices maintain more consistent battery efficiency compared to Android.  
- Android systems exhibit greater variability, potentially due to app or system optimization issues.
